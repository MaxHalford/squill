## Support for long schemas

- Gracefully handle connections with hundreds of projects.
- Moved from localStorage to [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for storing schema information, to avoid hitting the 5MB limit of localStorage.

## BigQuery

- Use the resource manager API to list projects, instead of the BigQuery API. This way all projects which have BigQuery enabled are listed, even those where the user does have a BigQuery `user` role.
- Corrected issue where only first 50 datasets and tables were shown in the schema browser.
