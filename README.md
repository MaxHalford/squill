# Squill

[![CI](https://github.com/MaxHalford/squill/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/MaxHalford/squill/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

I write a lot of SQL queries. I enjoy the experience provided by canvas tools such as [Count.co](https://count.co/). But they're either too expensive or too feature-bloated for my needs. So I made [Squill](https://squill.dev) — a lightweight, open-source SQL editor and database client that runs (as much as possible) in your browser.
