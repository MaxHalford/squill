# Squill

I write a lot of SQL queries. I enjoy the experience provided by canvas tools such as [Count.co](https://count.co/). But they're either too expensive or too feature-bloated for my needs. So I made [Squill](https://squill.dev) — a lightweight, open-source SQL editor and database client that runs entirely in your browser.
